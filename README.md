# Polling web application (Elixir, Phoenix, React js)
A single page exiting polling web applcation using: postgres, react js, elixir and pheonix.
Site link: (I unfortunately ran out of credits...)

#### With the plethora of CLI commands to learn, it is helpful to have an API which returns us commands that we often forget. This Commands API stores command line snippets along with a short description of what it does, as well as which platform it's for.
### An exit polling web application which allows (admin) to login and create polls which are shown on a dynamic results page (avaible to all users). The results page updates in real time. Build as part of my NEA for computer sciecne A level and recieved an A*.

### The primamry purpose of this project is to learn and practice concepts related to:
> - Building a REST API
> - Elxir lang
> - Phoenix web frame work
> - MVC Architectural Pattern
> - full stack deveopment
> - Sibling project intergration

#### More specifically, I used the following:
> - OTP + Actor model
> - Ecto Database library (ECTO - Repo, Schema, ChangeSet, Query)
> - Repository design pattern
> - PostgreSQL relational database
> - Argon2 password hashing encryption
> - User access control (auth plugs)
> - RESTful API guidelines
> - HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, status codes)
> - Phoenix channels (persistant web stocket connection)
> - PubSub 
> - Testing API Endpoints (SwaggerUI & Postman)

*Note: Please excuse the large comments in my code, they were used as notes for my NEA write up later.*
